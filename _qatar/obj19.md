description: 'Three Designs. Design 1: A sketch of a palm tree with five naked people
  around it holding hands. Text above the sketch reads "New College/Orientation 1999".
  Design 2: The sun setting behind the outline of the palm tree; meant to go behind
  the tree of Design 1. Design 3: Rippling water meant to go behind the tree of Design
  1. There is masking tape next to design 3. Past staple marks and red paint on the
  back of the fram indicates prior uses to this project, but the wood is still in
  relatively good shape.'
