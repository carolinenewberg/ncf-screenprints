description: 'Two designs. Design 1: Text that reads "EASTER EGG-/STRAVAGANZA/1999."
  Each number of "1999" is inside a drawing of an egg. Design 2: A duck stands over
  a drawing of a cracked egg that has opened to a group of people dancing in Palm
  Court. The duck has a thought bubble that reads "What The Fuck?" Holes from removed
  staples and blue, red, white, and black paint on the back of the frame indicate
  uses of the frame prior to the current frame.'
