description: 'Two designs. Design 1: The image of a femme-looking woman in a New College
  shirt and crown. They are smiling and have a speech bubble that says, "we''re here/we''re
  queer, we''re/gonna fuck your/children!" The design is taped off with duct tape.
  Design 2: A small design of several boxes connected by lines. The boxes have human
  figures in them, but are otherwise undecipherable. There are several spots of red
  paint that were presumably spilled after the screen was used. Yellow, blue, red,
  and black paint on the fram indicates uses prior to the current screen.'
