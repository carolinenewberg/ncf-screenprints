description: 'One design: At the topic, in block letters, text that says, "Bort".
  Below the text, there is a whimsical looking bee. Presumably this is Bort, the mascot
  of B Dorm. There is wear on the edges of the screen. No other paint colors besides
  black are present on the frame, indicating that the frame was likely only used for
  this project.'
