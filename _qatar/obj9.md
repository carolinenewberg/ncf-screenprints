description: 'Two designs. Design 1: Text that says, "The only Normal New College
  Subgroup to/get some Group Action on a Field trip/February 9-11, 2001." Below the
  text, there is an image of a bat symbol repeated in a circular shape. Design 2:
  Text that says, "Abstract Algebra Retreat 2001". Below the text is the silhouette
  of a seahorse. The screen was cleaned after its last use, so the only white paint
  is at the edge of the screen. There are spots of red and green around the edges
  as well (thought not as much as the white). On the frame, there is spots of green,
  blue, and black, indicating earlier projects.'
