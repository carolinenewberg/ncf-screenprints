Using Jekyll, Wax, and Github Pages, this digital exhibition displays screenprints from the New College of Florida Student Association Archives. This project is curated by Caroline Newberg. Infrastructure support from Jane Cook Library Digital Scholarship Studio.

This collection is comprised of **49 printing screens** made and used by new college students and staff. Screenprinting is a printing method used to reproduce designs on fabric, primarily t-shirts. The designs on the screenprints below would have been reproduced multiple times for different people. New College students made these printing screens because they thought the design was important enough to not only produce but reproduce and distribute. Therefore, by looking at these screens we can find out what kind of things New College students thought important enough to commemorate.
